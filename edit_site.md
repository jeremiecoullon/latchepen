# My first html file

Here is a basic [html tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) (it's not hard..).

To get started:
- Create a blank text file (using a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)), and add the `.html` extension (for example `my_hip_file.html`)
- Write some html. For example
```html
<h1>Le awesome header</h1>
<h3>Holy shit this header is slightly smaller</h3>
<p>
  I like writing html. Here is a link to a <a href="http://latchepen.com/">shit band</a>
</p>
```
- Open the file in your browser (ex: Chrome, Mozilla, Internet explorer) and see the result! You can make another change to the html file, save it, and refresh the browser


# Make an edit on latchepen_logo

- Make a [Github account](https://github.com/)
- Ask Jeremie to allow you to edit stuff on the Latchepen site.
- Go to the [Latchepen repository](https://github.com/jeremiecoullon/latchepen)
- Make an edit. For example:
  - on the 404 page (`404.html`)
  - Click on edit: the pen symbol at the top-right
  - Make an edit. For example add `<p>Here is another paragraph<p>`:
```html
<div class="center_stuff">
  <h1>404</h1>
  <p> fizla...</p>
  <p> Here is another paragraph!</p>
```
- Save the changes at the bottom of the page, under 'commit change'. Add a short description of your changes (for example: "updated gig list").
- After 30s/1min you'll see a change on the site. This change (above) will change the '404' page which appears whenever you go to a wrong URL (for example [http://latchepen.com/lala](http://latchepen.com/lala) or [http://latchepen.com/gypsyjazzzzz](http://latchepen.com/gypsyjazzzzz))
